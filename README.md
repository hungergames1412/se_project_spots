**Description & Functionality**

Spots is an interactive social media where users can share and like photos and personalize their profile. The web application is responsive from desktop to mobile with minor adjustments such as columns and rows.

**Technologies & Techniques**

Due to the use flexbox, grid, and media queries, the desktop version is available in the mobile version as well. In the profile section, flexbox allows the contents to transition. In the cards section, the grid template allows a smooth transition as each piece of content is uniform unlike the profile section. Media queries are used for when the size of the screen gets too small to contain the contents of the whole page.
